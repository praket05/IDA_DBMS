SOFTWARE TESTING - 23 AUGUST 2023


Why do products fail even after testing?

Ans - constant change in environment/technology, updating demands,requirements, 




Requirement analysis <-----------------------------> System testing
	     \						/
	high level design<------------------->Integration testing
		      \				/
		low level design<-------->Unit testing
				\        /
				  coding

PHASES OF STLC (SOFTWARE TESTING LIFE CYCLE) :


test strat -> identifying the strength and weakness. Make everything fail. identify types of test.
    |
test plan -> who does what. manual or automation testing. what softwares used for testing
    |
test design -> how are you going to write the test case. Test inputs, execution conditions, expected results.
    |
test environment -> where to execute the test case. Platform version, which OS, etc.
    |
test execution -> conducting the tests. test incident reports, test log, testing status and results. Then categorise the defects.
   | |
defect reporting -> categorising to minor or major defect and then prioritise the defects accordingly and give back to developers
    |
test closure

Design a test case for :
Select a product -> ADD TO CART FEATURE IN A E-COMMERCE WEBSITE

Steps to test a test case - 

Test id 

if the product is getting updated in the cart.
navigation
the icon of cart is getting updated.
total cost of cart is correct.
no negative qty option.
price updation according to qty


strat -> Performance testing, functional testing, usability, accesibility, 
plan -> 

 Test id          Test data         Steps to test       Expected output         Actual Output

Terms :-
defect, 
  deviation from requirement

bug, 
  Not working as per requirement.
  faults in system/app
  
failure, 
  if defects in the software are tested by tester  

error
  developer fails to understand the requirement.
